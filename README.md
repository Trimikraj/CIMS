## Custom Utility Class
To work with Csv file i have created a utility class ClientCsv 
which helps to write read all data from csv and write single row of data to csv. 

#### to use the utility class ClientCsv
*path should be absolute path*
*filename has to be with .csv extension*
```
$csv = new ClientCsv(path, filename);
```
